The name of the article would look funny but I think, that's where everything started. 
The reason why I can type, create, make and experience, including me, started off with the big bang 13.75 billion years ago!

Is there a God that caused it, I don't think so.
But I like God, because I keep finding out more about the concept!
If it makes you do good things, you're GOD too!

Yes, you too are God!

One planet, a little life, a concious self that acknowledges it. Positivity and good things! 
We're all good!


Big Bang
